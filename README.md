# Understanding-Income-Inequality
We have been given census data about attributes of US citizens (occupation, education, gender, race). With organizations working to ensure equal pay, we want to build a model to see how accurately we can classify low income from high income citizens. Building this model will allow us to understand which attributes contribute to affluency and how we can improve policies in the US.
